# 2D Java Game Engine

Welcome to the 2D Java Game Engine project! This engine is designed as a learning tool for those interested in game development using Java and LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library). The project is heavily inspired by a tutorial from freeCodeCamp, making it an excellent starting point for beginners.

## Description

This game engine is a work-in-progress and serves as an educational platform to understand the basics of 2D game development. It's built with simplicity in mind, allowing learners to grasp the core concepts without getting overwhelmed by complexity.

## Features

- **Simple 2D rendering**: Learn how to draw shapes, images, and animations.
- **Input handling**: Get to grips with handling user input from the keyboard and mouse.
- **Game loop**: Understand the fundamental game loop that drives the logic and rendering.
- **Learning-focused documentation**: Each part of the codebase is documented with learning in mind.

## Getting Started

To get started with this game engine, you'll need to have Java and Gradle installed on your system.

### Installation
